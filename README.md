- Story time!

# What is a Hackintosh?
- A "Hackintosh" is a custom built computer of non apple hardware, that runs OS X. While it doesn't necessarily have to be a
custom built computer, in most cases it is as it needs to meet specific hardware requirements. For this discussion, I will be focusing on a desktop build. 

# Whats the point? When I can just stroll down to the store a purchase a new Mac? 
- Well, first off Macs ain't cheap! 
- But more importantly, the beauty of a Hackintosh is (aside from the hardware requirements) allowing you to build it to suit your needs! You are not confined to the hardware limits from those purchased through Apple. You are free to customize any aspect of the build, adhering only to the budget you give yourself.

# What is required to build this so called Hackintosh?
- A Basic knowledge of a building a PC from scratch (even without this, following the build guides you can get by) 
- Well, first off you will need to determine what you are building your machine for in terms of how will you be using it?
- From here you will need to translate these needs into the hardware required: 
- The basic needs are:
-             - 8GB + Thumb Drive (for installing OSX later on)
-             
-             - Motherboard - Most Gigabyte Brand Boards work best (ASUS/ASrock also doable) 
-             
              - CPU - Stick with an Intel Based CPU (Core i3/i5/i7 depending on needs), AMD is possible but discouraged as it is difficult
              
              - RAM - 8GB + (Crucial Brand recommended) 
              
              - SSD - Solid State Drive - Best for OSX - Recommend SAMSUNG (though brand should not make a difference here)
              
              - HDD - Depending on needs and use, a second HDD is recommended storage
              
              - GPU - NVIDIA - Most natively supported without need for additional drivers with Yosemite (again this depends on your needs and what your build will be for) 


# So...How do I build one? 
- Well the easiest way requires having a Mac you can use to download the most current version of OSX, though you are free to start with a hard copy of Snow Leopard on disc. I would, however, reccomend starting fresh with a copy of Yosemite.
  - Utilize Unibeast to create a bootable drive of OS X
  - Utilize MultiBeast as an all-in-one post-installation tool designed to enable boot from hard drive, and installs support for Audio, Network, and Graphics. It also includes System Utilities to repair permissions and a collection of drivers and config files.
- Then.....Troubleshoot!!!

# Troubleshooting
- For me personally, I enjoy this process as when I first started building my first Hackintosh the documentation was not nearly as good as it is today. Supported builds were still disputed (with Snow Leopard/Lion), and the process to getting the machine actually to be completely functional was extremelty difficult. However, today the community has grown immensely and there are document builds you can follow excactly, or just sources of compatible hardware, walkthroughs, and support forms. Once you take the step towards building a Hackintosh and encounter issues, do not get discouraged this is where the fun begins! 
- Much like programming, breaking down the errors you are encountering into smaller issues and solving one issue at a time helps and attaining those EASY WINS are essential. 
- Before you know it you will have your very own Hackintosh rivaling that of even the newest Mac Pro released by Apple.
